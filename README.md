## Usage
You can use this application by clicking [here](https://lit-castle-67361-fccb0af3a0da.herokuapp.com/). <br>

<br> <img src="./client/src/images/screenshot1.png" style="border: 1px solid blue;" width=100% /> <br><br>
You can type any JavaScript you wish and when you click outside of the window, the changes will be saved to the indexedDB as well as local storage as a back up. This application will function offline and will sync to the database when the connection is restored. As a PWA, you can install the application to your device. Click on the install button and you will get a window prompt: <br>
<br> <img src="./client/src/images/screenshot2.png" style="border: 1px solid blue;" width=50% /> <br><br>
Click on "install" and the app will install to your device. Any changes made to the application via the browswer or the installed app will update the database so the user can access all data on either platform.
